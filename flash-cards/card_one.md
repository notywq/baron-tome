[category:Hero Skills] What are Marci's Skills?

# Back

## Dispose

Marci grabs an allied or enemy target and throws it effortlessly behind her, damaging and slowing the unit if it's an enemy. Any enemy units in the landing area will also be damaged and slowed.

## Rebound

Vector targeted. Marci bounds to the targeted unit, choosing a direction and distance she will spring away from it. Upon reaching the unit, Marci lunges to her final destination, damaging and stunning enemies in the area.

## Sidekick

Marci's loyalty helps ensure survival, imbuing a chosen allied hero and herself with lifesteal and attack damage.

## Unleash

Marci taps a hidden power, gaining Fury charges that allow her to deliver a rapid sequence of strikes. The last strike in every Fury combo creates a damaging pulse around the target that slows movement and attack speed for 50/100/150s. In between Fury combos, Marci is unable to attack for 1.5s.
